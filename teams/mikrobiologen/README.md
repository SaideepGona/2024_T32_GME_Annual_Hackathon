# Team Mikrobiologen: Katja, Rowan, and Matthias
GME hackathon 2024

### Download data from google drive

You need to download the data files required for our code to work from the shared google-drive at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SW5ZxSBR1YK19u9U-wVbtRXx3GZqmzvu?usp=sharing . The data is in the subdirectory `data/Mikrobiologen`. Download the two files `metadata_filtered.csv` and `metagenomics.csv`, and put the into a subdirectory `data` in the current folder

### Code for visualization

In the subdirectory `src`, you will find the jupyter-notebook `microbiome_umap_click_graph.ipynb`. Open this notebook and run all cells. The last three cells have the visualization of the umap and microbiome profiles.
